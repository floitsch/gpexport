procedure for compiling and installing the MS3D-exporter (MilkShake3D):

Requirements:
- gmake
- and of course Maya
- Skribe (search on Google), for the doc.

adapt the Makefile.inc to your configuration:
 - MAYA_LOCATION is hardcoded and might not point to
   your path.
 - C++, LD, PREFIX should be fine (but you can change them, if you want)

just run "make" to obtain the "MS3DTranslator.so" and "maya2ms3d" files
in the src-directory.
"make install" (as root) to install them.

"maya2ms3d" is an executable that takes a maya-file as input, and
writes a ms3d-file as output. ATM it takes no other parameters.

"MS3DTranslator.so" is the Maya-plugin. Hence it needs to be loaded
by it. If you don't want to (or just can't) install it into the main-
Maya-plugins directory, you can also copy it into the local plugin-
directory ~/maya/plugins or you can just search for it using "Browse"
in the Plug-In Manager.

MS3D_opts.mel is the options-script used during the export (so not
essential, but still handy). Again: if you don't want to install it
into Maya's main scripts-directory you can put it into one of the local
scripts directories:
- ~/maya/scripts
- ~/maya/5.0/scripts
Otherwise the Export-Options-dialog won't work.
